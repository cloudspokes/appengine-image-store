NOTES:
- Import this eclipse project, in order to try the application locally or to upload it to other location. You need to have installed the GAE eclipse plugin.
- In order to use the BlobStore a Credit Card number is required, if you hit any issue while uploading the application and you have not set your account with a credit card, that may be the problem.
- There is no "progress" indication while downloading images or while loading Image list, just give it a few seconds. (Something to improve).
- Tested on Firefox 3.6.x and Chrome.
